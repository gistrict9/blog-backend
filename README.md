# Backend Administation App For A Blog

This is a fully functional administrative backend for a blog. It contains the following:

- Devise authentication
- Creation of articles in HTML
- Kaminari pagination
- Tags
- Manage Drafts and Published articles
- Sunspot Solr searching
- Upload photos via Paperclip to AWS S3
- Dynamically load Github Gists
- Mobile ready

There is no form of role management at this time. It uses MySQL as the backend database.
